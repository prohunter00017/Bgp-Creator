<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome, young explorers, to the whimsical world of <strong>geometry-dash-clutterfunk</strong>! This level is like a magical adventure where every jump and flip is a step closer to unlocking awesome secrets. Imagine you're a tiny, brave cube, ship, or ball navigating through a land of bouncing pads, spinning rings, and tricky saw blades. Are you ready to dive in and discover the hidden treasures?</p>
<h3>Navigating the Fun</h3>
<p>In <strong>geometry-dash-clutterfunk</strong>, you'll face three main challenges: cube sequences, ship sections, and a super fun ball sequence. Each part of the game is like a different world with its own set of rules. The cube sequences will have you hopping through tight spaces and dodging gravity changes. The ship sections are all about flying high and low, avoiding obstacles like a pro. And the ball sequence? That's where you'll roll and flip your way through a maze of excitement!</p>
<h3>Secret Coins: The Hidden Treasures</h3>
<p>Now, let's talk about the coolest part – the secret coins! These shiny rewards are hidden throughout the level, and finding them is like discovering buried treasure. Here's a little hint to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First Coin:</strong> At 31%, while you're in ship form, glide over the fourth and fifth barriers by sticking to the ceiling. Keep your eyes peeled for a shiny coin waiting to be grabbed!</li>
<li><strong>Second Coin:</strong> At 65%, still in ship form, after passing through the second gravity portal, fly over a saw-blade and slip through a crack in the column to snag the coin. Then, soar over another saw blade to reach the fourth gravity portal.</li>
<li><strong>Third Coin:</strong> At 86%, during the cube segment, after hitting the first two jump rings and the jump pad, leap to the third jump ring. Keep jumping to reach the coin on the second line platform. Don't forget to hit the gravity ring to return to the main route!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<p>Did you know that completing <strong>geometry-dash-clutterfunk</strong> and Electroman Adventures in standard mode unlocks cool new ship designs? And get this – on average, it takes about 99 seconds to finish Clutterfunk, with a minimum of 125 leaps! That's a lot of jumping and flipping fun!</p>
<p>So, are you ready to embark on this thrilling adventure and unlock all the secrets in <strong>geometry-dash-clutterfunk</strong>? Grab your cube, ship, or ball and let the fun begin!</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Welcome, young explorers, to the whimsical world of Geometry Dash Clutterfunk! This level is a magical adventure where you'll jump, fly, and flip your way through a maze of fun challenges. Ready to unlock some cool secrets? Let's dive in!</p>
<h3>Navigating the Cube Sequences</h3>
<p>In Geometry Dash Clutterfunk, you'll start by controlling a cute little cube. The cube sequences are like a fun dance where you need to jump on pads and rings to keep moving forward.

<h3>Secret Coins</h3>
<p>Speaking of secret coins, let's dive into how you can unlock these shiny rewards. There are three hidden coins in Clutterfunk, and finding them will make you feel like a true treasure hunter.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first hidden coin is at 31%. You'll be in ship form, so fly like the wind over the fourth and fifth barriers, sticking to the ceiling after passing under the first obstacle. Grab the coin during this thrilling ride!</p></li>
<li><p>The second hidden coin is at 65%. After passing through the second gravity portal, maneuver over a saw-blade and slip through a crack in the column to acquire the coin. Continue flying over another saw blade to reach the fourth gravity portal. Don't worry; it won't affect your progress since you've already passed through the third one.</p></li>
<li><p>The third hidden coin is at 86% during the cube segment. After navigating the initial three-step structure and reaching the jump pad, hit the first two jump rings, followed by the jump pad, and then the third jump ring before descending onto line platforms separated by saw-blades. Keep jumping to reach the coin on the second line platform. Afterward, hit the gravity ring upon leaping from the third line platform to return to the main route via a jump pad.</p></li>
</ul>
