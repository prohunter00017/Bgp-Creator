As you play, keep an eye out for stars hidden in each level. Collecting them will give you the power to enhance your character's abilities, making it easier to tackle tougher challenges.</p>
<h3>Facing Monsters and Obstacles</h3>
<p>Every level in Geometry Stars is filled with new monsters and obstacles. Some levels might have spiky walls that you need to jump over, while others might introduce tricky monsters that you need to dodge. For instance, in one level, you might encounter a series of rotating blades that require precise timing to pass through. Stay alert and be ready for anything!</p>
<h3>Upgrading Your Character</h3>
