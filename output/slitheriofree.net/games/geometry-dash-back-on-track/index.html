<h2>Core Mechanics & Physics</h2>
<p>In Geometry Dash Back On Track, understanding the core mechanics and physics is crucial for mastering the level. This level introduces jump pads, which are essential for navigating the obstacles. Jump pads are neon-pink platforms that launch your icon into the air when you land on them. Unlike regular jumps, jump pads give you a higher and more controlled leap, allowing you to clear larger gaps and avoid deadly spikes.</p>
<p>The timing of your jumps is everything. Each jump pad syncs with the beat of the music, so listening to the rhythm and pressing your jump button at the right moment is key. For example, when you approach a jump pad, wait for the beat to hit, then tap your jump button. This will ensure you get the maximum height and distance from the pad.</p>
<p>Another important aspect is the physics of your icon's movement. Your icon moves forward automatically, and you control its jumps and flips. This means you need to be precise with your timing to avoid obstacles. Practice makes perfect—the more you play, the better you'll get at predicting when to jump and when to let your icon fly.</p>
<h3>Tips for Mastering Jump Pads</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Listen to the music: The beat will guide your jumps. Jump on the beat for the best results.</li>
  <li>Practice timing: Spend a few runs just focusing on hitting jump pads at the right time.</li>
  <li>Watch the path: Keep an eye on the upcoming obstacles so you can plan your jumps ahead of time.</li>
  <li>Use fast respawn: If you miss a jump, don't worry! The fast respawn feature lets you try again quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>By mastering these core mechanics, you'll find Geometry Dash Back On Track much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Happy jumping!</p>
