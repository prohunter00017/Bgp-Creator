<h3>1. Rushing Through Levels</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes players make is rushing through levels. It's easy to get excited and try to move too quickly, but this can lead to mistakes. Remember, in Geometry Vibes, precision is key. Take your time to carefully plan each jump and avoid obstacles. Try to focus on one jump at a time rather than thinking about the whole level.

<h3>3. Not Practicing Enough</h3>

Start with the easier levels to build your confidence and then gradually move to the more challenging ones. The more you play, the better you'll get. Remember, every game is a chance to learn and get better!</p>

<h3>4. Forgetting to Relax</h3>
<p>It's easy to get stressed when playing Geometry Vibes, especially if you're trying to beat a high score. However, staying too tense can actually make it harder to play well. Take a deep breath and try to relax before starting a new level. A calm mind helps you think clearly and react quickly. If you feel yourself getting too stressed, take a short break and come back to the game with a fresh mind.</p>

<h3>5. Neglecting the Game Modes</h3>
