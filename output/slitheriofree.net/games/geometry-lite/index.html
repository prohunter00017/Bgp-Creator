<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>Ready to become a Geometry Lite game master? Let's dive into the controls and get you started on your journey to mastering this exciting rhythm platformer! The controls are super simple, but don't let that fool you—this game is all about precision and timing.</p>
<p>To control your cube, you have three options: left-click, spacebar, or up arrow. Pick your favorite and get ready to jump into action! Each jump needs to be perfectly timed to avoid obstacles and navigate through the tricky terrain. Remember, even the smallest mistake can lead to a game over, so stay focused!</p>
<h3>Jumping with Precision</h3>
<p>When you press the left-click, spacebar, or up arrow, your cube will jump. The key is to time your jumps just right. For example, when you see a spike coming up, jump at the last moment to avoid it. If you jump too early or too late, you'll hit the spike and have to start the round over.</p>

<p>One of the coolest features in Geometry Lite is the ability to change your cube's shape. As you move through transformation portals, your cube will change into different geometric shapes like a flying spaceship or a spinning ball. Each shape has its own unique controls and challenges.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cube:</strong> Use left-click, spacebar, or up arrow to jump and avoid obstacles.</li>
  <li><strong>Spaceship:</strong> Hold down the jump button to fly upwards and release to descend.</li>
  <li><strong>Ball:</strong> Your ball will automatically roll forward, so you'll need to time your jumps to navigate through gaps and over obstacles.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these controls and a bit of practice, you'll be well on your way to becoming a Geometry Lite game master. Happy jumping!</p>
<h2>Core Mechanics & Physics</h2>

<h2>Common Mistakes (and Fixes)</h2>
<p>Hey there, future game masters! Ready to conquer Geometry Lite? Awesome! But wait, even the best players can stumble. Let's dive into some common mistakes and how to fix them so you can become a Geometry Lite pro!</p>
<h3>Mistake 1: Jumping at the Wrong Time</h3>
<p>One of the most common slip-ups is jumping at the wrong moment. Imagine you're trying to leap over a spike, but you jump too early or too late—ouch! To avoid this, keep your eyes glued to the beat of the music. Each jump should sync with the rhythm. Practice makes perfect, so don’t get discouraged if you miss a few times. Soon, you’ll be jumping in perfect harmony with the music.</p>
<h3>Mistake 2: Not Paying Attention to Shape Changes</h3>
<p>Did you know your cube can transform into different shapes? Yep, it’s true! But if you’re not paying attention, you might find yourself in a tricky situation. For example, when your cube turns into a flying spaceship, the controls change. Instead of jumping, you’ll be flying! Make sure to watch for transformation portals and adjust your strategy on the fly. It’s like being a chameleon—adapt or get left behind!</p>
<h3>Mistake 3: Rushing Through Levels</h3>
<p>We get it, you’re excited to beat the level. But rushing can lead to mistakes. Take your time and focus on each obstacle. Whether it’s a set of spinning cogs or a tower of spikes, careful navigation is key. Think of it like solving a puzzle. Each move should be deliberate and precise. Remember, it’s not a race—take your time and enjoy the ride!</p>
<h3>Mistake 4: Ignoring the Music</h3>
<p>The music in Geometry Lite isn’t just background noise; it’s your guide! Each beat matches the movements of your cube. If you ignore the music, you’re setting yourself up for failure. Try to internalize the rhythm. Tap your feet or nod your head to the beat as you play. Soon, you’ll find that the music helps you anticipate the next move. It’s like having a secret soundtrack to success!</p>
<h3>Mistake 5: Giving Up Too Soon</h3>
<p>Last but not least, don’t give up if you fail a level. Every pro player faces challenges. What sets them apart is their persistence. Take a deep breath, learn from your mistakes, and try again. Each attempt brings you closer to mastering the level. Remember, every great game master started as a beginner. Keep practicing, stay positive, and you’ll be dashing through levels like a pro in no time!</p>
