<h2>Common Mistakes (and Fixes)</h2>
<p>Hey there, young explorers! Geometry Dash Kenos is an amazing adventure, but even the best players can get stuck. Here are some common mistakes you might run into and how to fix them.</p>
<h3>1. Rushing Through Sections</h3>
<p>One of the biggest mistakes is rushing through the sections. Remember, Geometry Dash Kenos is all about timing and precision. Take your time, especially in the fast-paced sections. For example, in the 0-7% (Eclipsed) section, you'll control a cube jumping on walls and hitting orbs. If you rush, you might miss an orb or hit a spike. Slow down, focus on each jump, and you'll get through it!</p>
<h3>2. Ignoring Gravity Changes</h3>
<p>Gravity changes can be tricky, but they're super important. In the 14-31% (Bianox) section, you'll face a mini-wave part with inclined obstacles and gravity portals. If you ignore the gravity changes, you'll end up hitting spikes or missing orbs. Pay close attention to the screen and adjust your jumps accordingly. Practice this section until you feel comfortable with the gravity shifts.</p>
<h3>3. Not Using Dash Orbs</h3>
<p>Dash orbs can be a lifesaver, especially in tight sections. In the 74-80% (Salaxium) section, you'll encounter a double-speed part with dash orbs and challenging timings. Use these orbs to zip through tough spots. If you see a dash orb, don't hesitate to use it! It can help you avoid spikes and reach orbs that are hard to get to.</p>
<h3>4. Forgetting to Hit Orbs</h3>
<p>Orbs are crucial for progressing through the level. In the 31-36% (Terron) section, you'll navigate a lengthy UFO segment with narrow spaces between spikes. Make sure you hit every orb you come across. Missing an orb can throw off your timing and make the rest of the section much harder. Keep your eyes peeled and your fingers ready!</p>
<h3>5. Getting Frustrated</h3>
<p>Lastly, don't get frustrated if you don't beat Kenos on your first try. This level is super challenging, and even the best players need practice. Take a break if you need to, and come back with a fresh mind. Remember, every attempt helps you get better. Keep practicing, and you'll conquer Geometry Dash Kenos in no time!</p>
