<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hey there, young explorers! Ready to dive into the exciting world of <strong>geometry-dash-blast-processing</strong>? This level is a real treat with its cool 3D effects and challenging gameplay. It's rated 8 stars, which means it's pretty tough, but don't worry—we've got some awesome tips to help you master it!</p>
<h3>What Makes Blast Processing Special?</h3>
<p>Blast Processing stands out with its 3D embellishments that make the game look super cool. You'll also see the wave shape in long, uninterrupted sequences, which adds a whole new level of challenge. This level is all about timing and precision, so get ready to dash hard and glow brighter!</p>
<h3>Two Tricky Spots to Watch Out For</h3>
<p>There are two tricky spots in Blast Processing that you should be aware of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>After the twin wave section, if you bypass the deactivation dual portal, the second cube part will start upside-down. But don't worry! You can still finish the level by quickly jumping after entering the cube portal and leaping over the blocks.</li>
  <li>Right after the first ball segment, when you re-enter the wave form, tapping or clicking right after entering the wave portal will skip the gravity portal. This lets you use anti-gravity to sail through the wave section, dual wave, and part of the cube section.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Find Those Secret Coins!</h3>
<p>There are three hidden coins in Blast Processing that you can collect to boost your progress. Here's where to find them:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first coin is at 52%, and you get it while in wave form. Enter the third enormous diamond after passing through the dual portal.</li>
  <li>The second coin is at 69%, and you can grab it while in UFO mode. Navigate through the "mouth" of the third major barrier towards the ground, just after passing under the second large face obstacle.</li>
  <li>The third coin is at 86%, and you collect it while in ship form. Look for the cube with artificial spikes and slide beneath the obstruction to get the coin.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Fun Trivia</h3>
<p>Did you know that Blast Processing introduces artificial slopes as part of collecting the first hidden coin? These slopes aren't fully shown until the Theory of Everything 2 level. Also, the level isn't named after its Newgrounds song, which is titled "-BlastProcess-," but in other places, the song is called "Blast Processing."</p>
<p>So, are you ready to take on the challenge of <strong>geometry-dash-blast-processing</strong>? Grab your cube, wave, UFO, and ship, and let's dash into some fun!</p>
<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Welcome, young explorers, to the thrilling world of Geometry Dash Blast Processing! This level is a real challenge, but with some awesome tips and tricks, you'll be dashing through it like a pro. Get ready to learn some cool skills and have a blast!</p>
<h3>Mastering the Wave Form</h3>
<p>One of the coolest parts of Geometry Dash Blast Processing is the wave form. You'll spend a lot of time as a wave, so getting good at it is super important. Here's a fun way to practice: try to stay in the wave form for as long as you can without hitting any obstacles. Focus on smooth, flowing movements. Imagine you're a surfer riding the waves—stay balanced and keep moving!</p>
