The level is divided into several sections, each with its own set of challenges and surprises. Let's break down what you can expect as you journey through this epic level.</p>
<h3>Section Breakdown</h3>
<p><strong>0-12%:</strong> Your adventure begins with a slow cube part that requires pinpoint accuracy. Be careful of the fake spikes—they're tricky!</p>
<p><strong>13-22%:</strong> Next up is a fast ship sequence. Fly straight, time your actions perfectly, and don't forget to enter the fake block in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>23-27%:</strong> Get ready for a cube spam frenzy followed by three tricky half-speed jumps and your first wave section.</p>
<p><strong>28-44%:</strong> The first wave part is a real test of skill. Navigate through narrow corridors, double-click when descending, and master the one-second mini-wave spam. Watch out for saw-blades and gravity portals!</p>
<p><strong>45-50%:</strong> This section is all about teamwork. Control a ball and a mini-wave with precise timing.</p>
<p><strong>51-64%:</strong> Brace yourself for the infamous two-player dual wave. Spam clicks accurately with two inverted gravity waves and navigate through three tricky corridors.</p>
<p><strong>65-100%:</strong> The final stretch is the most intense. Survive the mini-wave spam, handle invisible speed changes, and collect blue orbs as you guide your mini-waves through the shifting path. The level ends with a slow mini-wave section displaying the creators' names, 'Cyrillic' and 'Sailent'.</p>
<h3>Control Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jump:</strong> Use the left-click button, the spacebar, or the up arrow key.</li>
