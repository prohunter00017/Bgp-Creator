<p>Precision is key in this dark, tight-route section. The background turns darker, making it even more challenging to see obstacles.</p>
<h3>26-30%</h3>
<p>The darkness continues, making it harder to spot obstacles. Some negative comments add to the tension, but the gameplay remains tough.</p>

<h3>63-66%</h3>
<p>This section remains mostly the same with added details. Take a specific approach to avoid falling on spikes.</p>
<h3>67-72%</h3>
<p>An extension begins with a monster carrying you and a message indicating it's not over. Follow a fast-paced ship sequence and a challenging robot part.</p>
<h3>73-76%</h3>
<p>Experience a half-speed wave part with tight passages, then switch to fast-paced UFO and ball gameplay.</p>
