<p>Ready to dive into the frosty fun of Geometry Subzero? Let's get started! In this game, you'll control a cube that can change states as you dash through icy landscapes. Your mission? Avoid all the hazards and reach the end of each level. It sounds simple, but the road is full of sharp spikes, saw blades, and tricky platforms. Each jump and move needs to be perfect!</p>
<p>To control your cube, you can use the mouse button, spacebar, or the up arrow key. But here's the catch: you need to pay close attention to the changes in the cube's state. Sometimes, your cube might turn into a different shape or move in a new way. When this happens, you'll need to adjust your controls to keep going. For example, if your cube turns into a flying mode, you might need to use the spacebar to flap its wings and stay in the air.</p>
<p>One of the coolest things about Geometry Subzero is the catchy melodies that play as you dash through the levels. These tunes make the game even more exciting and help you stay focused. Plus, with only three levels, each one feels like a unique adventure. And don't worry if you find it tough—you can always try practice mode first. It's like a warm-up session that helps you get ready for the main challenge.</p>
<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Stay Alert:</strong> Keep an eye on the changing states of your cube. Each change requires a different control method.</li>
