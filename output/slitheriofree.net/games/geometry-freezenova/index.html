<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>Welcome to the dazzling world of Geometry Freezenova! This game is like a neon-lit adventure where you get to dash through magical worlds, dodge obstacles, and unlock cool secrets. Ready to dive in? Here’s how to play and some tips to help you unlock those awesome hidden treasures!</p>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>When you first start Geometry Freezenova, you'll control a cube that zips through a series of neon-colored levels. Your mission is to guide this cube to the end of each level without crashing into any obstacles. Sounds simple, right? Well, it’s a bit trickier than it seems!</p>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>To control your cube, you can use the mouse button, spacebar, or the up arrow key. But here’s the fun part: your cube can transform! When you pass through special portals, your cube might turn into a flying triangle or a spinning sphere. Each form requires different controls, so you’ll need to be quick on your fingers!</p>
<h3>Levels and Challenges</h3>
<p>Geometry Freezenova has ten levels, each more challenging than the last. As you progress, the terrain gets trickier, and the obstacles become more diverse. Don’t worry if you find it tough at first. Even the best players had to start somewhere!</p>
<h3>Unlocking Secrets</h3>
<p>Did you know there are hidden secrets in Geometry Freezenova? Yep, they’re there! To unlock these cool surprises, you’ll need to collect coins scattered throughout the levels. Use these coins to buy new characters, each with their unique abilities and styles. For example, try unlocking the “Neon Ninja” character who can dash through levels faster than a speeding comet!</p>
<h3>Tips for Success</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice Makes Perfect:</strong> Don’t get discouraged if you fail a level. Keep trying, and you’ll get better with each attempt.</li>
<li><strong>Watch for Patterns:</strong> Many levels have patterns in the obstacles. Once you spot them, you’ll know exactly when to jump, slide, or transform.</li>

<h2>Advanced Strategies</h2>
<p>Ready to unlock the coolest secrets in Geometry Freezenova? Let's dive into some awesome strategies that will make you a master of the neon world!</p>
<h3>Secret Portals and Hidden Paths</h3>
<p>Did you know that some levels have secret portals? These sneaky shortcuts can help you breeze through tricky sections. Keep an eye out for glowing spots on the map—those are your clues! For example, in Level 5, there's a hidden portal behind a tricky spike wall. Jump through it, and you'll skip a whole bunch of obstacles!</p>
<h3>Character Transformations</h3>
<p>Your cube isn't just a cube—it can transform into different shapes! Each shape has its own special moves. For instance, when you turn into a sphere, you can roll through tight spaces that a cube can't fit through. In Level 7, there's a narrow tunnel that only a sphere can pass. Make sure to hit the transformation portal right before it!</p>
<h3>Coin Collecting Tips</h3>
<p>Coins aren't just for show—they help you unlock new characters! But collecting them can be tricky. Try to plan your jumps so you can snag coins without losing momentum. In Level 3, there's a row of coins right above a dangerous pit. Use your double jump to grab them all in one go!</p>
<h3>Rhythm and Timing</h3>
<p>Geometry Freezenova is all about rhythm. The music cues you in on when to jump, flip, or transform. Pay close attention to the beat! In Level 9, the music slows down just before a big jump. Use that moment to time your leap perfectly and avoid the spikes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Practice levels on easy mode first to get a feel for the rhythm.</li>
  <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use headphones for the best audio experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these tips, you'll be dashing through neon worlds like a pro. Happy gaming!</p>
<h2>Common Mistakes (and Fixes)</h2>
<p>Hey there, geometry-freezenova whiz! Ready to dive into some cool secrets and learn how to avoid those pesky mistakes that can zap your progress? Let's jump right in!</p>
<h3>Mistake 1: Rushing Through Levels</h3>
<p>We get it—Geometry Freezenova is super fun, and you want to blaze through all ten levels like a neon comet! But hold your horses! Rushing can lead to some major oopsies. For example, you might miss those sweet, sweet coins that unlock awesome new characters. Take it slow, focus on each jump, and you'll find those hidden treasures in no time.</p>
<h3>Mistake 2: Ignoring Character Transformations</h3>
<p>Did you know your cube can transform into different shapes? Yep, it's true! But if you're not paying attention, you might miss the special portals that trigger these changes.

Keep an eye out for those portals and get ready to switch it up!</p>
<h3>Mistake 3: Forgetting to Collect Coins</h3>
<p>Coins aren't just for show—they're your ticket to unlocking super cool characters! Some players get so caught up in dodging obstacles that they forget to scoop up the coins. Remember, every coin you collect brings you one step closer to unlocking that awesome new character. So, keep your eyes peeled and your fingers ready to grab those glittering prizes!</p>
<h3>Mistake 4: Not Exploring Each Level</h3>
<p>Each level in Geometry Freezenova is like a new world waiting to be discovered. Some players zip through without taking a moment to explore. But did you know that hidden pathways and secret areas can lead to extra coins and cool surprises? Slow down a bit, take a look around, and you might just find some hidden gems!</p>
